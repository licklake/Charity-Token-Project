# Charity Token Project

Have you ever tried to donate cryptocurrency to some charity? If yes, you probably had the same issues I had. First of all, finding a charity organisation that supports cryptocurrency as a way to donate is really really hard. But if you managed to do that, you run into the next problem. That is, can you trust the page you landed on, or is it just a scam that wants to make fast money? Well, you can't be sure. And even if you are and have already sent some coins over there - Wouldn't it be great to receive a little reward on your own. Like a "thank you" for doing something good or even the possibility to help others doing the same? This project could be the answer.
